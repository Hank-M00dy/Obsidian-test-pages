# WORK IN PROGRESS

Welcome, this is the start of my journey into publishing online, iv heard it called a few different things but I like "working with the garage door open"

I was introduced to this concept and liked the idea of opening up my ideas and notes to the public. The goal is to document projects I'm working on and publicly share my study notes for various courses and certifications iv done and am taking.

By sharing my Projects I hope to foster easier collaboration and inspire others to try new things

By sharing my notes I hope to provide a knowledge base myself and others can refer to. My aim is to bring a lot of different topis of interest together into one place, hopefully relevant to one another when viewed as a whole.

The overall structure will be as follows

## landing page
The central hub, this should allow you or I to navigate to information quickly and foster exploration
## [[Journal]]
link to a journal like blog use to quickly link to new content and track changes
## [[Knowledge Base]]
Link to the knowledge base, I often forget how extensive the field of IT really is and how easy it is to forget the fine print when solving a problem. this section will be cram full of useful specs and info like what is the real difference between cat5e and cat6
## [[Projects]]
Link to a projects section where I can document notes on things I'm working on outside of official tracks or projects inspired by what iv been studying
## [[My Favourite Software]]
A collection of software that I have personally used
