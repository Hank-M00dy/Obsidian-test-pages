# WORK IN PROGRESS
This site is very new, so please check back often for new content. I've added a 'What's New' segment to this page so you can see right away if anything has been added recently. I will keep it to three entries, but a complete list can be found in [[Journal]]

Welcome, this is the start of my journey into publishing online, I heard it called a few different things but I like "working with the garage door open" or "public digital garden"

I was introduced to this concept and liked opening up my ideas and notes to the public. The goal is to document projects I'm working on and publicly share my study notes for various courses and certifications I've done and am taking.

Some of my notes will be unfinished, this is to be expected, the creator of this repo has the opinion that if what you post doesn't have to be perfect or finished then you become much more relaxed about what makes it to your site. So don't be surprised if in the future you find unfinished pages, they are simply a work in progress, an un-weeded or un-planted part of my digital garden.

By sharing my [[Projects]] I hope to foster easier collaboration and inspire others to try new things.

By sharing my notes I hope to provide a knowledge base myself and others can refer to. I aim to bring a lot of different topics of interest together into one place, hopefully, relevant to one another when viewed as a whole.

The overall structure will be as follows:

## [[Index]]
The central hub should allow you or me to navigate to information quickly and foster exploration.
## [[Journal]]
Link to a journal-like blog use to quickly link to new content and track changes
## [[Knowledge Base]]
Link to the knowledge base, I often forget how extensive the field of IT is and how easy it is to forget the fine print when solving a problem. This section will be crammed full of useful specs and info like what is the real difference between cat5e and cat6
## [[Projects]]
Link to a projects section where I can document notes on things I'm working on outside of official tracks or projects inspired by what I've been studying
## [[My Favourite Software]]
A collection of software that I have personally used
