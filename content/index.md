# WORK IN PROGRESS
This site is very new so keep checking back often for new content, iv added a 'what's new' segment to this page so you can see strait away if anything has been added recently, I will keep it to 3 entry's but a complete can be found in [[Journal]]

Welcome, this is the start of my journey into publishing online, iv heard it called a few different things but I like "working with the garage door open" or "public digital garden"

I was introduced to this concept and liked the idea of opening up my ideas and notes to the public. The goal is to document projects I'm working on and publicly share my study notes for various courses and certifications iv done and am taking.

Some of my notes will be unfinished, this is to be expected, the creator of this repo has the opinion that if what you post doesn't have to be perfect or finished then you become much more relaxed about what makes it to your site. So don't be surprised if in the future you find unfinished pages, they are simply a work in progress, an un-weeded or un-planted part of my digital garden

By sharing my Projects I hope to foster easier collaboration and inspire others to try new things

By sharing my notes I hope to provide a knowledge base myself and others can refer to. My aim is to bring a lot of different topis of interest together into one place, hopefully relevant to one another when viewed as a whole.

The overall structure will be as follows

## [[Index]]
The central hub, this should allow you or I to navigate to information quickly and foster exploration
## [[Journal]]
link to a journal like blog use to quickly link to new content and track changes
## [[Knowledge Base]]
Link to the knowledge base, I often forget how extensive the field of IT really is and how easy it is to forget the fine print when solving a problem. this section will be cram full of useful specs and info like what is the real difference between cat5e and cat6
## [[Projects]]
Link to a projects section where I can document notes on things I'm working on outside of official tracks or projects inspired by what iv been studying
## [[My Favourite Software]]
A collection of software that I have personally used

# What's new

- 12/11/2024
	- The Explorer section displayed on the left of the screen appears as a numbered list, they appear like this because each section resides in a folder and iv numbered them to be in a specific order, I don't like how it looks so I'm removing it, should make it look a bit cleaner

- 11/11/2024
	- Added my first entry into the software category, Space Monger, read about it here [[My Favourite Software]]
		- Fixed an issue with this page, the text was wrapping around the image incorrectly, its like it wants to continue flowing after the image tag without starting a new line. I dont have this issue when starting a new line with a bullet point. Manually adding a new line between image and text fixed this issue

	- Learnt how to modify the graph view, with default settings the text was to large when zoomed in and was all bunched together making it unreadable
		- in VS Code I opened the Graph.tsx file within quartz/components and modified 3 settings, I'm pretty happy with how this now displays when zoomed in
