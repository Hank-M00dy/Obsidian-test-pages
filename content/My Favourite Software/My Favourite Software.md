I would say that this program has made it onto every install of windows I have ever done. Its a space analyser/visualiser. No need to install, just open this portable utility and point it at a drive installed or plugged into your computer and after a short scan will display the folders and files as coloured boxes. The best part is the larger the files the larger the boxes.

I have used this utility more times than I can count and reach for it whenever my drives are getting full and I need to move or delete some files to free up space.Â It gives me immediate visibility of where big folders and files are placed on my drives.

There is a cavate though, I use a specific version, 1.4.0, the reason for this is later versions of Space Monger are not freeware. But as long as 1.4.0 keeps working, ill keep using it.
