**A history of edits to the site**

# 19/11/2024
- formatted and filled gaps in my notes for 2 more sections and published
	- added [[1.6  network services]]
	- added [[1.7  Datacentre network architecture]]
- took 2 articles off draft in the projects section, need to embrace posting stuff before its finished
- made a small addition to [[CD DVD Recovery]], added observations about the condition of the media
- copied everything from the what's new section to the journal and edited this section down to 3 entry's
- now that the 3 most recent Journal entry's are being displayed on the main page I searched for a way of referencing [[Journal]] instead of copy pasting.
	- I found that Obsidian already has syntax for that
		- `![[page your referencing#Heading]]`
			- by changing the dates to headings instead of dot points I can just reference the date on the index page which gets rid of duplicate effort
			- eliminates the chance there will be discrepancies between 'what's new' and 'Journal'

# 12/11/2024
- The Explorer section displayed on the left of the screen appears as a numbered list, they appear like this because each section resides in a folder and iv numbered them to be in a specific order, I don't like how it looks so I'm removing it, should make it look a bit cleaner

# 11/11/2024
- Added my first entry into the software category, Space Monger, read about it here [[My Favourite Software]]
	- Fixed an issue with this page, the text was wrapping around the image incorrectly, its like it wants to continue flowing after the image tag without starting a new line. I dont have this issue when starting a new line with a bullet point. Manually adding a new line between image and text fixed this issue

- Learnt how to modify the graph view, with default settings the text was to large when zoomed in and was all bunched together making it unreadable
	- in VS Code I opened the Graph.tsx file within quartz/components and modified 3 settings, I'm pretty happy with how this now displays when zoomed in
