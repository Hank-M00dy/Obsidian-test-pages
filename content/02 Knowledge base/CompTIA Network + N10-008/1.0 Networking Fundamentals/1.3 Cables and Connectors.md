## Copper Cabling – N10-008 CompTIA Network+ : 1.3
[video](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/copper-cabling-3/)
### Transcript
Network administrators work with many different types of copper cables. In this video, you’ll learn about cable categories, coax, twinax, and 568A and 568B termination standards.

Copper cabling is the foundation of our Ethernet networks. If you have a network at home, you’re usually connecting with copper Ethernet cable. Whenever we’re building out new networks, we need to make sure that we’re using the correct type of cable for the type of network that we’re installing. And of course, anything that we’re plugging into our network, whether it is a copper wired network or a wireless access point will ultimately come back to that wired connection.

If you were to look inside any of our twisted pair Ethernet cables, you would see four pairs of wires. And you would see that the pairs are twisted around each other. These wires are sending equal and opposite signals down both sides of the wires. You’ll sometimes see this referred to as transmit+ and transmit- or receive+ and receive-.

The reason for sending these opposite signals down the same wires is that we’re taking advantage of the twist, because the wire is twisted, it’s always moving away from any noise or interference that may be occurring anywhere close to the cable. This allows us to compare those signals on the other end, reconstruct what may have been damaged or interfered with during the transmission, and be able to properly receive the total signal.

You’ll also notice that the different pairs have different twist rates, which is another way that we could use to be able to reconstruct that signal on the other side. There are different ways to construct twisted pair cabling using different types of cables and different ways to manufacture the cable itself. These different characteristics of cables are called categories of cables. And we use these categories to determine what type of cable we would use for a different type of network.

For example, if you’re using 1000BASE-T, the IEEE 802.3 standard tells us that we could use category 5 cables to be able to send this gigabit Ethernet connection to a maximum distance of 100 meters. This category 5 cable is a type of category we no longer use. We’ve updated that category to category 5e. The E is for enhanced.

So when you see 1000BASE-T being used, we’re using a minimum of category 5e these days to be able to go 100 meters. But if you happen to have some older category 5 that’s still in the wall and you would like to send 1000BASE-T signal over it, it’ll work great up to 100 meters in length.

If you’re running 10 gig Ethernet, that’s 10GBASE-T, you need a minimum of category 6. If you’re using unshielded twisted pair cable, that supports up to 55 meters in length. And shielded cable will support 100 meters in length. If you’re using category 6A– the A means augmented– you can still run 10GBASE-T to a distance of 100 meters. And if you have category 7– this is a shielded type of cable– it will use 10GBASE-T for that 10 gigabit Ethernet up to a 100 meter distance as well.

And if your requirements are for 40 gigabit Ethernet using the 40GBASE-T standard, then you want to use category 8, which is a shielded cable. And its maximum supported distance is 30 meters.

Not all cable connections are twisted pairs. Sometimes you may be using coaxial cable. Coaxial means that you have two or more forms using the same access. And in this case, it is a single wire conductor that’s used in this particular coax cable. This is commonly the coax cable we would use for cable modem connectivity, for example.

If you look at the coax that’s used inside of your home, you can look on the outside of the cable. And it’s probably labeled to be an RG-6 or a similar type of coax. This is what we normally use for television, our digital cable connectivity, and for our digital internet connections. This is the type of cable you would commonly use for television and for your cable modem connections.

Twinax is similar to coax, except instead of having one single conductor inside the cable, there are two separate conductors, the twins in the twinax. This is the type of cable you would commonly see associated with 10 gig Ethernet over copper, specifically using SFP transceivers. This allows for full duplex connection, because you do have two connections– one for send and one for receive. But it does have a limited distance when used with 10 gig Ethernet. It has a distance of about 5 meters in length.

But because it is coax, it is a copper cable and has a relatively low cost when you compare it to fiber connectivity, especially fiber connectivity on the devices. This is also a very efficient copper cable connection with a lower latency than twisted pair cabling.

One of the things you’ll notice if you go from place to place or company to company is that all of their structured cabling, all of their Ethernet wires, and everything that’s connected inside of their network is identical from location to location. This is by design. There are a set of standards that dictate exactly how you should install and use these twisted pair and copper cable connections. These are the international ISO/IEC 11801 cabling standards.

Inside of North America, you would commonly see the Telecommunications Industry Association standards, or the TIA standards, specifically the ANSI/TIA-568 standard, which is the commercial building telecommunications cabling standard. If you want more information on the TIA, you can find it on their website at tiaonline.org.

The TIA-568 standard is extensive. But for the purposes of what we’ll talk about in this video, we’re going to talk about the standards associated with pin and pair assignments of eight-conductor 100-ohm balanced twisted pair cabling. This is the cable we often use when we’re using Ethernet networks. Specifically, we’re going to talk about two types of standards, the T568A and the T568B.

These 568A and 568B standards dictate what type of colors of cables we will use when punching down these Ethernet connections. The T568A standard has a different set of colors than the T568B standard. But by using either the A or the B standard, we can be assured that we’re matching an A or B standard that’s used anywhere else almost universally.

The standard itself mentions times when you may want to use T568A colors and T568B colors. For example, it mentions that if you’re using horizontal cabling, you would probably use T568A. But many organizations use 568B. Normally, an organization would pick which standard they’re going to follow, and then they use that for their entire infrastructure.

So if you’re walking into an organization and you’re wondering which standard to follow, you simply ask somebody, what do you use here? Do you use 568A or 568B, or you can look at their existing cables and see what colors they’re currently using. There are differences between the T568A and the T568B.

So it’s important that you punch down or use the same standard on both ends of the cable. You don’t want to use T568A on one side and 568B on the other. That creates a lot of confusion. And you may find that the cable is not working as expected.

You may find some documentation that tries to compare the 568A or B standard with Ethernet crossover cables. But the 568A or B standard is not related to Ethernet crossover. Crossover cables are defined in the IEEE 802.3 standard, and not in the 568 standard. We’ll go through crossover cables and how this applies to the colors used in crossover cables in a later video.

Here are the colors used for these two standards. We’re specifically looking at these colors based on the eight wires that are inside of an RJ45 connection. And you can see they’re numbered numbers 1 through 8. For the T568A and 568B, you can see that some of the wires are different, but some are the same. For example, pins 4 and 5 are blue and white and blue in both standards, and pins 7 and 8 are white and brown, and brown in both standards.

The only two pair that are different between the standards are pins 1 and 1 and pins 3 and 6. You can see in 568A pins 1 and 2 are white and green and green, and pins 3 and 6 are white and orange and orange. In the T568B standard, those colors are simply reversed.

One way to tell what standard is being used in a particular cable is to look very closely at the colors that are along the outside. And we should be able to map back what each individual color is and make sure that it correlates back to one of the A or B standards. In this example, we can look at the back of this cable, and we can put that B standard right next to it and see that each one of those colors does match up. So this particular connector is wired with the T568B standard.

This would be good to try yourself. Grab an Ethernet cable you have sitting around. Have a look at the wires that are on the connector, and see if yours are wired for T568A or T568B.

### Transcript
Fiber networking allows a network administrator to send traffic over long distances and through areas of high electromagnetic interference. In this video, you’ll learn about fiber networking and understand the differences between multimode and single-mode fiber communication.

If you’re physically connecting to a network and you’re not using copper, then you’re probably using fiber optics. This is network communication using light to communicate instead of electrical signals. This means there’s no radio frequency that someone could listen in to, to be able to hear what’s happening on the network.

And because we’re communicating with light, we can send the signal over very long distances without having that signal degrade. Fiber optics are also immune to radio frequency interference, which makes them perfect for environments where copper cable couldn’t be used.

Here’s a close up of some fiber optic connectors. You can see where the connector is plugging into the equipment is quite large. It has a large protector around the fiber, itself. The fiber is, actually, inside is very small and very thin. We use fiber optic cables by sending light from one end of the cable to the other. This light is often created using an LED, but it might also use a laser. The light is sent inside of the fiber, finds its way through, and ultimately is received on the other side.

This fiber optic cable is made of many different layers. The internal layer is the core of the fiber optic. This is a highly reflective core, which allows the light to come into the fiber and bounce around the fiber until it makes its way to the other side. Protecting the core is a cladding. The cladding is a low refractive index, which means if any light does leak out into the cladding, it won’t be reflected back into the core.

And on the outside is a protective coating that is usually colored to designate what type of fiber might be on the inside. Here’s a close up of an SC connector. Inside of this SC connector is a fiber optic. You can see in the very middle is a very light colored fiber, and all around that is a protective ferrule. This allows you to plug in this connector and unplug it without damaging the fiber that might be on the inside.

When you’re installing fiber in your facility or connecting two devices with a fiber optic connection, you’re probably using one of two different types of fiber, a multimode fiber and a single-mode fiber. Multimode fiber, usually, is for short-range communication, often up to two kilometers or so. And it often uses an LED or some other inexpensive light source.

We call this multimode fiber because the core of the fiber, itself, is larger than the wavelength of light that is being sent through it. And you’ll find that the light is reflecting through multiple modes as it goes from one side to the other. In this case, you can see an example of different modes as they’re passing through this fiber.

The other type of fiber you might see is single-mode fiber. Single-mode fiber has a smaller core than multimode fiber, and it only allows one mode of light to transmit through that core. We often see single-mode fiber used for very long distances. Some implementations of ethernet can run over single-mode fiber up to 100 kilometers without needing to recreate, or retransmit, that light.

To be able to send a signal over that very long distance, we need a light that’s stronger than an LED, which is why you’ll commonly see laser beams being used to send traffic over single-mode fiber. This is why the cost of single-mode equipment and single-mode fiber, itself, tends to be more expensive than multimode fiber.

## Network Connectors – N10-008 CompTIA Network+ : 1.3
[Video](https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-008/n10-008-video/network-connectors-2/)
### Transcript
There are many different connectors used on fiber and copper network links. In this video, you’ll learn about the various kinds of connectors that are used on common networking equipment.

One popular fiber optic connector is the LC or local connector. This connector has two different fibers inside of it, usually this is a send and receive. And you can see that it plugs in with these locking connectors at the top.

To be able to remove this from a connector, you have to push down and then you’re able to remove it from the interface. These are relatively small connectors. And because of that, they’ve become pretty popular on our most recent routers and switches, because you can fit so many of them into such a relatively small space.

Some connectors that are slightly larger than the LC are the ST connectors, the straight tip connectors. And this is a connector type that’s been around for quite some time. These connectors also lock in place, but they use bayonet connectors. So you plug them in and slightly twist them, and they’re locked in place. You have to untwist and then pull to be able to remove an ST connector from a device.

Subscriber connectors are these square connectors. In fact, sometimes you’ll hear the subscriber connector or SC described as a square connector, because they do have this relatively square face. When you’re plugging in SC connectors, they might be connected individually as separate fibers, or you may be plugging into fibers simultaneously. These lock into place with a unique locking mechanism that once you push it in, is locked in place. You have to pull back on the spring-loaded connector around the fiber to release it from that interface.

And the last type of fiber connector we need to know for the Network+ exam is the MT-RJ. This is the mechanical transfer registered jack. You can see that it is a very small connector. It does have two tiny fiber connectors at the end of it. And of the other connectors, this one probably is the one with the smallest amount of real estate that it takes on a switch or router.

If a manufacturer is looking to fit the maximum number of fiber connectors into the smallest available space, then they’re probably going to use this MT-RJ connector. Very similar to the LC connector, the MT-RJ has a locking mechanism at the top. And when you want to remove it from the interface, you push down so that lock disengages, and then you can remove it from the interface.

One of the challenges with fiber optics is that we’re dealing with light as a transfer mechanism. And so there’s all sorts of physics that go into the idea of making sure the optimal amount of light is getting from the beginning to the very end of the connection. One very important statistic is the return loss. This is how much light is reflected back to the source and thereby creating an inefficiency in the amount of light that you’re able to send to the other side.

To be able to minimize the amount of return loss, we have different connectors that we might use. One of these connector types is a UPC connector or an ultra-polished connector where the ferrules are connecting together at a 0-degree angle. They are facing each other directly. This type of connector tends to have a high return loss.

One type of connector that has a lower return loss is an APC or angled polished connector, because there is a very slight 8-degree angle between the connector types. And when you’re using this type, instead of having all of that light reflected directly back to the source, it is reflected back at an angle away from the source.

Here’s a cross section of a UPC connector. You can see that these two sides are connecting right in the middle at 0 degrees. This means that the light going out and hitting that connection is reflecting back a little bit of that light back to the original station, creating the high return loss. This is different than an APC connector where there’s a slight 8-degree angle where those two fibers meet. This means that the light that is moving down the fiber is hitting that angle. And some of that light is being reflected back, but it’s being reflected back at an angle, giving you much less of a return loss than something that is a UPC connection.

Now that we looked at fiber connectors, let’s have a look at some copper connections. One that’s very common with voice communication is an RJ11 connector. That RJ stands for registered jack type 11. This is a sixth-position connector. But only two of the conductors are actually inside of this cable. Sometimes you’ll see this written as a 6P2C.

You can see all six of these positions in this image, but you can see that only two of them have conductors inside of them. If you run into a cable or a connector that has the six positions, but four of those conductors are in use, we commonly also refer to this as an RJ11, but technically it’s an RJ14 because of that slight difference. You’ll commonly see these connectors used for things like DSL connections or analog telephone connections.

We commonly use a slightly larger connector for our ethernet connections. This is an RJ45 connector or register jack type 45. In the case of an RJ45, there are eight positions. And all eight conductors are used for these ethernet connections. Sometimes it’s difficult to differentiate between an RJ11 and an RJ45, because they are constructed very similarly, but the size of the connectors is quite different.

Here’s a view of both RJ11 and RJ45 connectors on the same device. You can see the RJ11 is slightly smaller than the RJ45. And sometimes, when you’re troubleshooting, you’ll find that people might plug in an RJ11 cable into an RJ45 connector, which obviously is not going to work properly. Most of those times you can easily unplug from the RJ45, plug into the correct RJ11, and the user will be up and running.

If you’re using a cable modem, then you’re probably connecting using a coax cable from the cable company. This coaxial connector is called an F-connector. This is the type of connector you will find on a cable modem. And it follows the standards associated with DOCSIS or Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification. Many times this is an RG-6 type of coax cable. And the connector at the end is most commonly threaded to make sure that once that cable is inserted that it can’t easily be removed from that connection.

Here’s a close up of the threaded F-connector on the cable modem and the F-connection that’s on the cable itself. You would insert this cable and twist it until it’s tight, which will help keep it in that connection and won’t allow it to easily pull out of that cable modem.

## Network Transceivers – N10-008 CompTIA Network+ : 1.3

### Transcript
Network transceivers are commonly used to provide modular connections on network equipment or network interface cards. In this video, you’ll learn about some of the common transceiver types and how they are used on modern networks.

If you work on a network for any amount of time, you will eventually run into a scenario where you need a fiber connection and all you have is a copper connection, or vice versa. In order to create the type of connection you need, you may need to use a media converter. This is a device that operates at OSI layer 1 and converts the signals of one media type to the signals of a different media type.

For example, you can extend a copper wire over a very long distance by converting that copper connection to fiber, extending it over that long distance, and then converting it back to copper on the other end. Or it may be that you only have fiber connections in a wall or a connection between two sites, but your switches only have copper ports. So you can convert temporarily to fiber while you extend that connection between those two switches.

Although it doesn’t show it in this picture, there’s probably a power connector that’s on the back of this media converter, which is very common, especially if you’re moving between fiber and copper connections. Here’s an example of converting from a copper connection on a switch to fiber. This switch only has five interfaces on it, and all five of those interfaces are copper. In order to connect this switch to a fiber connection, we will first connect to a media converter, which makes the conversion to a fiber connection. And one in this particular case has a transceiver that we can use to specify what type of fiber we’ll connect to.

Here’s an example of using these media converters in a much larger implementation. This one appears to be in a data center, where there are multiple media converters all stacked together within the same chassis. You can see that there’s fiber to copper being used on almost all of these connectors, and this modular type of interface allows you to remove a media converter and reinsert a converter that has the type of conversion you need.

In this particular example, you can see that most of these happen to be using ethernet connections on the top, but then there’s varied type of connectors on the bottom. They might be converting to a fiber connection or converting to other copper connections. On one of those images of a media converter, we saw that they were using a transceiver to specify what type of fiber connection they wanted to use. The term transceiver means that there is a transmitter and receiver usually contained within the same physical component.

This is a modular interface that allows you to plug in exactly the type of connection you’d like to use, which means that, no matter what you’re using, you should be able to plug in the proper transceiver and make that connection. There are many different kinds of transceivers that correlate to the type of fiber or copper connections that you’ll be plugging into, and it’s very common to keep a handful of these around in case you ever need to plug in or convert between a different network type.

This is an example of where those transceivers can really be useful, because most of the interfaces on the switch are copper interfaces. But the uplink ports on the switch allow you to either use the built-in copper interface or to plug in your own transceiver and be able to connect to that network type. With most of these transceivers, you’ll commonly see two separate fibers being used for the connection. One of these fibers would be the transmit fiber, and the other fiber’s used exclusively to receive any information.

If you’re connecting to transceivers then, you would have one fiber that is using the receive side of one transceiver and plugging into the transmit side of the other. Conversely, on that side, the receive side of that transceiver would plug into the transmit side on the reverse transceiver. There are times, though, where you might run into a limited number of fibers on a connection, and you may not have two fibers to be able to send and receive traffic across separate individual optic fibers.

In that case, you may want to use a transceiver that is a BiDi transceiver, or a bidirectional transceiver. This allows you to both send and receive traffic over a single strand of fiber. So you can see that one wavelength of communication is being sent on the transmit side, and on that same piece of fiber you have a receive side, all being used on that same fiber connection. If you do happen to have two fibers then, you can run two individual connections, which effectively doubles the amount of connections that you would have had with a non-bidirectional transceiver.

There are many different types and form factors for transceivers. One of the most common is an SFP, or small form factor pluggable. This connector that we used in that switch is an SFP connection. If you’re plugging in 1-gigabit connections, then you’re probably going to use an SFP. The SFP we have here is a fiber SFP, but they also make copper SFPs for connecting copper connections over gigabit links.

There’s an enhanced version of the SFP called an SFP plus. This is a small form factor pluggable that is enhanced to be able to increase the throughput of that transceiver. It’s exactly the same size of an SFP, but it supports rates up to 16 gigabits per second, making it a perfect type of connector to use for your 10-gig Ethernet links. As with most network infrastructure devices, you can get more value from that device if you can fit more interfaces into a smaller area.

In order to do that, we might use a transceiver that’s a QSFP, or a quad small form factor pluggable. These are slightly larger than a traditional SFP, but they fit four times the amount of information. This is a four-channel, SFP, which means you can have four 1-gigabit connections, or a total of 4 gigabits of throughput through a single QSFP. Just as an SFP has an SFP plus, the QSFP has a QSFP plus that has also four channels.

But instead of being four channels of an SFP, it has four channels of an SFP plus. That means that you can easily fit four 10-gig connections– meaning a 40-gigabit link– using a single queue QSFP plus. This means you’re not only saving space on the infrastructure equipment– you’re also saving the amount of fiber that you’re using between those connections. And to extend that efficiency, you could use bidirectional QSFPs and bidirectional QSFP pluses, meaning that a single fiber run can effectively double the amount of throughput through this single QSFP connection.

Here’s the difference in size between the SFP or SFP plus and the little bit larger QSFP and QSFP plus. You can see there’s not much of a difference between them, but there is obviously a difference in the size of the form factor. You’ll need to check your device to see exactly what type of transceiver it’s looking for, because you can’t easily use an SFP plus, if that device is expecting an SFP. Make sure you check the documentation of the device that you’re connecting to to make sure that you’re plugging in the right type of transceiver for that device.

## Cable Management – N10-008 CompTIA Network+ : 1.3

### Transcript
It’s always a challenge when managing hundreds or thousands of network connections in a single wiring closet or computer room. In this video, you’ll learn about cable management techniques, patch panels, and punch-down block options.

If you’re working with cabling in a large office, then you’ll notice that there is a well laid out and well-designed way to manage all of these cable connections. Often there will be users at their desks. You can see all of these users out on the floor, and there is a direct cable connection, usually going under the floor or over the ceiling, back to a closet. And in that closet, there’s usually a patch panel. Those wires from the desks are usually punched down into that patch panel using something like a 110 block.

On the other side of that patch panel is commonly an RJ45 connector, and that RJ45 connector allows us to plug in from the user’s desks and extend that connection into switches that we might also have in that same closet. One of the keys with this design is that the wire from the desk will always connect into the 110 block, and once you’ve run that cable and punched it into the patch panel, you generally never need to move that wire again. All the wiring changes occur on the other side of the patch panel.

For example, if you had this last connection on this patch panel and you wanted to move it from one switch to the other, you don’t change any of the wires back to the desk. You simply unplug the connector that was plugging into the top switch and you plug it into the bottom switch. You can then, of course, add other users to that switch out on the floor, but again, you’re not touching any of those runs between the user’s desk and the patch panel.

Patch panels can have RJ45 on one side and punch-down connections on the other, or the patch panel might have punch-down connections on both sides. This allows you to make moves, adds, and changes to the network by plugging into the front of those patch panels, rather than changing any of those wires that go back to the desk. Here’s a better view of this patch panel in use.

The patch panel is here on the bottom and the switch is on the top. This is the run going back to the user’s desk. We’ll simply extend that wire by adding a patch cable between the patch panel, and we’ll plug that patch cable into the switch that’s also on the same rack. Now the user has a connection that has been extended all the way to the switch, and they should be able to use the resources on the network.

We don’t tend to run fiber connections from someone’s desk, generally due to the expense associated with installing fiber, but we will commonly run fiber between floors of a building or between separate buildings themselves. On both sides of that fiber run, we will often install a fiber distribution panel. That’s because we rarely run a single pair of fiber between connections. If we’re going through the cost and expense of running that fiber optic connection, we will generally run more than one fiber at a time.

This distribution panel is designed with these loops on the inside, because there is a maximum bend radius that you have to associate with fiber optics, and you don’t want to bend this fiber too tightly. So when you installed them into this fiber distribution panel, you’ll notice these large loops that are being used in order to prevent any of that bending. You’ll also notice there’s a little bit of extra fiber inside of these loops and distribution panels. That’s because there may be times when that panel needs to be moved. And instead of rerunning the entire fiber connection, you can simply extend that fiber using the slack or additional fiber that you have wrapped up inside of that service loop.

Once you start connecting and using different types of patch panels, you’ll notice that some patch panels are using different blocks to be able to punch down those wires. One of the very early types of common blocks is a 66 block. We very commonly use this for analog voice communication, and if you have a lot of analog telephones in your facility, you may have a lot of 66 blocks that are on the wall with lots of wires plugging in to those blocks. With many of these blocks, you would connect one side of the connection on the left side and the other side of the connection on the right to be able to extend that.

You would plug in the wire into these very tiny connectors using a punch-down tool. You don’t have to have any type of connector, like an RJ45 connector. You simply put the wire right on top of the connector, and you would punch it into the block using that punch-down tool. We don’t generally use 66 blocks any longer. They were usually focused on analog voice, and as we move to digital and high speed ethernet connections, we tend to use 110 blocks.

The 110 block is not a dramatic departure from the 66 block, but it does have a different style of connection on it. But it’s effectively the same type of physical connection. This supports category 5 and category 6 cables, and you would have a punch-down tool that allows you to punch the wire into those 110 block connectors. Usually there is another connector you can put on top of this block that might give you access to an RJ45 connection or additional punch-down connections that you can use to extend the copper connection.

Here’s a close-up of the wires that have been punched into the connectors on the block. You can see the wires still have the insulation around them. You don’t have to remove that insulation. You simply push them into the block and the connectors on the block bite into the insulation, making a solid connection to the copper that’s inside. Here’s another view of a 110 block from the top. This is one side of a patch panel. And you can see all of those individual wires have been punched down, and you can even see the metal that’s used to bite into the insulator and make that solid connection to the copper that’s inside.

If you’re in Europe, you may be using a Krone block. This is a similar type of punch-down block, but it’s one that was specifically made by a company called Krone. You’ll see these used for analog and digital communication, and there’s many different models of Krone blocks that can support different speeds and different types of communication. The Krone block has the same basic function as a 66 block or a 110 block, where you plug the wires in, you have a punch-down tool that completes the connection, and now you’re able to have this modular extension of the copper wire.

Another type of block you might find is a BIX block, or a building industry cross-connect. There have been updates to these BIX standards over the years, and the most modern BIX blocks can support category 6 and better connections, allowing you to run very fast ethernet over a BIX block. Here’s a closer view of that BIX punch-down block, and you can see it’s the same basic function as some of the other blocks, where the wire is inserted into the block, it’s punched down, and the block makes that connection with the copper inside of that wire.

### Transcript
There are many ways to implement an Ethernet network. In this video, you’ll learn about the different speeds and connectivity types for popular Ethernet standards.

By far, Ethernet has to be the most popular networking technology in the world. It is used in practically every organization to connect devices and be able to connect us together using the internet. To be able to make all of these Ethernet connections work, we use many different types of cabling, different types of equipment, and different types of connector. These days, our modern Ethernet networks will use fiber and twisted pair copper, but you may run into other types of connectors as well.

One common technology used across many of these different Ethernet standards is baseband technology. This means there is a single frequency that’s using the entire medium. That means across this wired connection or fiber connection, we are using a single type of frequency to be able to transmit these Ethernet signals. This is different than a broadband connection. With broadband connectivity, you have a single wire, but you’re sending many different frequencies across that wire, effectively sharing the medium for all of those different communications channels.

If you have some older 10-megabit Ethernet cable running over twisted pair wire, then you’re probably using the 10BASE-T standard. The 10 would be for 10-megabit, the BASE would be for the baseband technology that’s used on that wire, and generally, you’d see a T or a TX at the end to specify that that is twisted pair. 10BASE-T uses two pairs of wire within that cable, which is different than the four pair that we commonly see with gigabit Ethernet technology, and this only requires Category 3 cable. This goes back a number of years, and Category 3 was perfectly acceptable to run 10-megabit Ethernet. The maximum distance supported with 10BASE-T Ethernet is a 100-meter distance.

We increased the speed of our Ethernet networks 10 times and created 100-megabit Ethernet. This is 100BASE-TX. Sometimes you’ll see this referred to as fast Ethernet, although these days, 100-megabit Ethernet is not the fastest that you will commonly find. This also used two pairs of wires within that cable, and it uses a minimum of Category 5 cable extended over a 100-meter maximum distance.

We improved the Ethernet technologies and introduced 1000BASE-T, or what is known as gigabit Ethernet over Category 5 cabling. This uses all four pairs of wires within that single cable, and although Category 5 cabling is now deprecated, we tend to see Category 5e used in its place. This move to use all four pairs of wires within the cable is very different than the two pair that was used for 10BASE-T or 100BASE-TX.

That’s why you’ll sometimes see some patch cables that only have two pairs of wires run inside of them because they were made for the older standards. And if you try to use those with 1000BASE-T, you won’t be able to get gigabit speeds. As with 10BASE-T and 100BASE-TX, the maximum allowed distance in the 1000BASE-T standard is 100 meters.

Increasing these speeds again by a factor of 10, we can support 10GBASE-T standard, or 10 gig Ethernet over copper with this four pair balanced twisted pair cabling. This uses a higher frequency to communicate across this connection. Normally, 125 megahertz was the frequency of signal that you would see on a gigabit Ethernet cable. For 10GBASE-T, we’re using frequencies of 500 megahertz. That increased frequency rate translates into more data being sent across this connection.

10GBASE-T requires a minimum of Category 6 cabling, and if you’re using unshielded cable, the maximum supported distance for the 10GBASE-T standard is 55 meters. If you’re using shielded cables, you can go up to 100 meters in length. There’s also Category 6A cabling, that A stands for Augmented, and Category 6A can support 10GBASE-T over shielded or unshielded cabling up to 100 meters.

One of our newer Ethernet standards is 40GBASE-T, and as the name implies there, this is 40 gigabit per second Ethernet over twisted pair cabling using all four of the pairs within that cable. This requires a minimum of Category 8 cable, and it only allows communication up to 30 meters based on the 40GBASE-T standard.

When you add fiber as a method of communicating between devices, you can extend the speeds and distances of this Ethernet signal. 100-megabit Ethernet over fiber can be used with the 100BASE-FX standard. This is a pair of multi-mode fiber. In fact, it uses some of the same fiber technologies that we used back in the FDDI networking days, for those of you that remember back to those time frames. Just as there are Ethernet standards for copper cabling, there are also Ethernet standards for fiber.

If you wanted to send 100-megabit Ethernet over fiber, you could use the 100BASE-FX standard. This uses a pair of multi-mode fiber. In fact, it’s the same fiber type that we were using for the older FDDI technologies, so this standard would allow us to move between FDDI to the new 100BASE-FX by using the same fiber that we have already run.

This commonly uses lasers to be able to send that light and can communicate over half-duplex to a maximum distance of 400 meters, and using full-duplex, we can go to 2 kilometers. There’s a less expensive version of this 100-megabit Ethernet over fiber standard with the 100BASE-SX. This allows us to communicate 100-megabit Ethernet using LED optics, which tend to be less expensive. But this also limits our distance to be able to send this signal to 300 meters.

If you’re running gigabit Ethernet over fiber connections, you might be using 1000BASE-SX. This is gigabit Ethernet using a short wavelength laser. And as the name implies, this is a shorter distance than a longer wavelength laser that we’ll look at in a moment. This allows us distances over multi-mode fiber to extend 220 meters to 550 meters depending on the type of fiber that you’re using.

If you wanted to have a longer distance that’s supported, you might want to use the 1000BASE-LX standard. This is also gigabit Ethernet, but it’s using long wavelength laser to send the light. On multi-mode fiber, you can extend this to 550 meters, and for single-mode fiber, you can go to a distance of 5 kilometers.

10-gigabit Ethernet standards are also available for fiber connections. The 10GBASE-SR, or Short Range, uses multi-mode fiber to be able to extend 26 to 400 meters depending on the type of fiber that you’re using. If you want to go very long distances using 10-gigabit Ethernet, you might want to use the 10GBASE-LR standard, the LR is Long Range, and using single-mode fiber, we can extend that to 10 kilometers as its maximum distance.

You’ve seen some examples of using Ethernet signals over fiber, but it would be useful if we could send multiple types of signals over the same strand of fiber. We’re able to do that using a technology called WDM, or Wavelength-Division Multiplexing, where we can have bidirectional communication over a single stranded fiber for multiple types of signals. This uses different wavelengths for each carrier that we happen to be sending across that fiber. You can think of this as sending different colors of a signal over the same strand of fiber.

One common type of WDM is Coarse Wavelength-Division Multiplexing, or CWDM. This is the 10GBASE-LX4 standard using four separate 3.125-gigabit per second carriers at four different wavelengths. If you want to fit more signal over that fiber, you might want to use DWDM, that’s Dense Wavelength-Division Multiplexing, and it is dense. This is multiple carriers on a single fiber. You can have 160 signals and increase the total throughput to approximately 1.6 terabits per second.

Multiplexing is in the name. That’s what’s really happening when we send this traffic through this fiber. Here are three different sources of signal going into the multiplexer being then sent across a single fiber, and on the other side, we’re demultiplexing those signals onto their separate streams.
