# 1.5 Explain common ports and protocols, their application, and encrypted alternatives.

- **non-ephemeral port numbers**
	- Also known as "well-known" or "reserved" ports
	- Typically used for common, standardized services that clients need to access reliably
	- They are fixed and do not change across sessions, unlike ephemeral ports
	- Ranges from **0 to 1023**
	- Commonly assigned by the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA)

- **ephemeral port numbers**
	- unlike the destination port, the sending port is chosen from a set range, the range varies from OS to OS and is used by the client as an outgoing port number. This allows data to reach the correct origin point upon return.
	- Ranges from **1024 to 65535**
	- Dynamically assigned by the operating system for short-lived connections
