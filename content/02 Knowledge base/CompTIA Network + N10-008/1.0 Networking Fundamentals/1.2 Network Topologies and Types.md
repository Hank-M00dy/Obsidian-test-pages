# 1.2 Explain the characteristics of network topologies and network types.

-  **Mesh**
	- Is a network where every node is connected to every other node
	- Mesh topologies create multiple interconnections between devices, which is ideal for redundancy and fault tolerance. 
	- If one link fails, other paths in the mesh allow data to reroute, maintaining network functionality. 
	- This is often used in wide area networks and IoT setups, where devices communicate in a self-healing, interconnected mesh.

-  **Star/hub-and-spoke**
	- In a star topology, devices connect to a central hub, commonly seen in switched Ethernet networks where the switch acts as the central point.
	- This setup is highly reliable as devices only connect to the hub, not directly to each other. 
	- It is common in most network designs for its simplicity and centralized management.

-  **Bus**
	- The bus topology uses a single communication line, typically a coaxial cable, with all devices connected along it. 
	- This was used in early Ethernet networks but has limitations: a single cable failure can disrupt the entire network.
	- Bus topologies are still common in specific applications like automotive CAN (Controller Area Network) systems, connecting sensors and controllers in vehicles.

-  **Ring**
	- Ring topology connects devices in a circular manner. 
	- Common in wide area networks, it provides redundancy by looping data back if a link fails, ensuring continued communication. 
	- This is especially useful in metropolitan area networks for maintaining uptime even if a connection is interrupted.

-  **Hybrid**
	- Hybrid topologies combine multiple topology types to suit specific network requirements.

-  **Network types and characteristics**
	- **Peer-to-peer**
		- A decentralized network where each device acts as both a client and server, enabling direct data sharing among devices. Cost-effective but challenging to secure and manage.
	- **Client-server**
		- A centralized network where clients access resources through a dedicated server. Easier to manage and configure but requires additional infrastructure and costs.
	- **Local area network (LAN)**
		- A high-speed network within a small area, like an office or home, typically using ethernet or Wi-Fi. Common for local resource sharing with minimal delays.
	- **Metropolitan area network (MAN)**
		- A network covering a city or region, often provided by third parties, commonly used by organizations with geographically spread locations.
	- **Wide area network (WAN)**
		- A long-distance network connecting locations over large areas. Slower than LAN due to extended distances, often uses fiber, satellite, or MPLS connections.
	- **Wireless local area network (WLAN)**
		- A LAN variant using wireless 802.11 connections, typically with a limited range. Multiple access points can extend connectivity within large areas or buildings.
	- **Personal area network (PAN)**
		- A short-range network connecting personal devices via Bluetooth, such as headsets or smartphones, enabling communication within a few meters.
	- **Campus area network (CAN)**
		- Connects multiple buildings within a single campus, like universities or corporate sites, using private infrastructure for high-speed connectivity.
	- **Storage area network (SAN)**
		- Dedicated to data storage at the block level, providing efficient access and faster modifications than network-attached storage (NAS).
	- **Software-defined wide area network (SDWAN)**
		- Uses software-defined routing to manage connections based on data type, especially useful for cloud-based resources, allowing direct access without central routing.
	- **Multiprotocol label switching (MPLS)**
		- A WAN technology using labels for routing, compatible with various data types and connection types, simplifying routing through label-based decisions.
	- **Multipoint generic routing encapsulation (mGRE)**
		- A dynamic VPN technology enabling flexible, temporary connections between remote sites, optimizing data flow by creating links as needed.

-  **Service-related entry point**
	- **Demarcation point**
		- The physical point where a third-party service provider's responsibility ends, and the customer's network begins, important for network boundaries and service management.
	- **Smartjack**
		- A network device at the demarcation point that allows testing and monitoring of the provider's service, helping to troubleshoot and manage network connections.

-  **Virtual network concepts**
	- **vSwitch (Virtual Switch)**
		- A switch that has been moved into the virtual environment
	- **Virtual network interface card (vNIC)**
		- A vNIC is a virtualized version of a physical network interface card (NIC) that connects a virtual machine (VM) to a network.
		- Each vNIC allows a VM to communicate over a network as though it had a physical network card.
		- vNICs can be managed within a hypervisor and assigned unique IP addresses, VLANs, and network policies.
	- **Network function virtualization (NFV)**
		- NFV is a technology that virtualizes network functions (e.g., firewalls, routers, load balancers) traditionally handled by dedicated hardware.
		- This approach enables these functions to run on virtualized infrastructure, often improving flexibility, scalability, and cost-efficiency.
		- NFV is commonly used in cloud computing and telecom, where it allows rapid deployment and management of network services.
	- **Hypervisor**
		- A hypervisor is a layer of software that creates and manages virtual machines (VMs) on a host system, allowing multiple VMs to run on one physical machine.
		- There are two types: **Type 1 (bare-metal)** runs directly on hardware (e.g., VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V), and **Type 2** runs on a host OS (e.g., VirtualBox, VMware Workstation).
		- The hypervisor allocates resources (CPU, memory, storage, network) and isolates VMs to ensure security and efficient performance.

- **Provider links**
	- **Satellite**
		- Satellite internet uses satellites orbiting Earth to provide broadband access.
		- Data travels between a satellite dish on the ground and satellites in space, then to the internet backbone.
		- Often used in rural or remote areas where traditional broadband options aren't available.
		- It has higher latency due to the long-distance data must travel, but can still provide decent speeds.
	- **Digital subscriber line (DSL)**
		- DSL uses existing copper telephone lines to deliver internet access.
		- Speeds vary based on the distance from the user’s location to the provider’s central office.
		- DSL is typically slower than cable and fiber-optic options but is widely available, especially in areas with established phone lines.
		- Two main types: Asymmetric DSL (ADSL) offers faster download speeds than upload speeds, while Symmetric DSL (SDSL) provides equal speeds in both directions.
	- **Cable**
		- Cable internet uses the same coaxial cables as cable TV.
		- It offers high-speed internet access and is generally faster than DSL, though speeds can fluctuate based on network congestion.
		- Bandwidth is shared with other users in the same area, which can affect performance during peak times.
		- Widely available in urban and suburban areas.
	- **Leased line**
		- A leased line is a dedicated, symmetric connection that offers consistent high-speed internet access.
		- It’s a direct connection from the provider to the customer, not shared with others.
		- Used by businesses for reliable internet with high upload and download speeds.
		- More expensive than consumer options, but ideal for critical applications needing stability and low latency.
	- **Metro-optical**
		- Metro-optical networks, also called metropolitan area networks (MANs), use fiber-optic cables to deliver high-speed internet across a city or metro area.
		- Often used by businesses or telecom companies to connect multiple locations within a metropolitan region.
		- Provides extremely high speeds and low latency, with higher capacity than traditional consumer options.
		- More expensive but supports very demanding applications
