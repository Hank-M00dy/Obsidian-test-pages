Saw a great video from Network chuck implementing his version of what I have done with this site  [Link](https://youtu.be/dnE7c0ELEH8?si=0TZFKgFWP_ge-7FU)

There are some fundamental differences between the two implementations

**Note storage**
The blog pages I write currently live in there own [[Obsidian]] vault and nothing private is stored there. One folder stores the vault and the static site generator together, my private notes are in a completely different location. 

Network Chucks looks a lot neater, everything you write, private and public is in one vault, the static site generator is separate, he uses robo copy on windows and rsync on Linux to sync the folder containing the markdown files to the project folder of hugo, they are separate like mine but he only has to work within one vault, I like this idea.

**Static Site Generator**
My site uses Quartz which is a GitHub project

Chucks uses Hugo

Quartz used to be based on Hugo, I believe as of version 4 the team have removed it.

... to be continued, I'm only half way through the video and its getting late :)
