# 1.6 Explain the use and purpose of network services.

- **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
	- DHCP is a network management protocol used to dynamically assign IP addresses to devices, allowing them to communicate on the network without needing manual IP configuration.

- **Scope**
	- A DHCP scope defines a range of IP addresses that can be assigned to clients on a specific subnet.

- **Exclusion Ranges**
    - Exclusion ranges define specific IP addresses within a DHCP scope that should not be assigned to any client, often reserved for servers, printers, or other fixed devices.

- **Reservation**
    - A reservation is a pre-defined IP address within the scope that is always assigned to a specific device, identified by its MAC address.

- **Dynamic Assignment**
    - Dynamic assignment is the default DHCP mode where available IP addresses are assigned to clients as they connect to the network.

- **Static Assignment**
    - Static assignment (or manual assignment) is when IP addresses are manually configured on the device itself, rather than assigned by the DHCP server.

- **Lease Time**
    - The lease time specifies how long a device can use an IP address before needing to renew it. After expiration, the address may be reassigned if not renewed.

- **Scope Options**
    - Scope options allow DHCP servers to send additional configuration settings (like default gateway, DNS server, etc.) to clients along with the IP address.

- **Available Leases**
    - This refers to the number of IP addresses left in the DHCP scope that can still be assigned to clients.

- **DHCP Relay**
    - DHCP relay enables devices on different subnets to obtain IP addresses from a central DHCP server, forwarding DHCP requests between clients and the server.

- **IP Helper/UDP Forwarding**
    - IP helper addresses are configured on routers to forward DHCP requests (or other UDP broadcasts) to a remote DHCP server.

- **DNS (Domain Name System)**
	- DNS is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, allowing users to reach websites and services by entering familiar names.

- **Record Types**
    - Different types of DNS records store various pieces of information:
        - **A vs. AAAA**: 'A' records map a domain to an IPv4 address, while 'AAAA' records map a domain to an IPv6 address.
        - **CNAME (Canonical Name)**: CNAME records create an alias for another domain name, pointing one domain name to another.
        - **MX (Mail Exchange)**: MX records specify the mail servers responsible for receiving email for a domain.
        - **SOA (Start of Authority)**: SOA records contain administrative information about a DNS zone, including the primary name server and zone serial number.
        - **PTR (Pointer)**: PTR records map IP addresses to domain names, used in reverse DNS lookups.
        - **TXT (Text)**: TXT records contain text information and are often used for security and verification, like SPF or DKIM records for email.
        - **SRV (Service)**: SRV records indicate the location of specific services, often used for applications like SIP or LDAP.
        - **NS (Name Server)**: NS records specify the authoritative DNS servers for a domain.

- **Global Hierarchy**
    - The DNS system has a hierarchical structure:
        - **Root DNS Servers**: Root DNS servers are at the top of the DNS hierarchy and direct requests to the appropriate top-level domain (TLD) servers, like .com or .org.

- **Internal vs. External**
    - Internal DNS servers resolve names within a private network, while external DNS servers provide public name resolution for domains on the internet.

- **Zone Transfers**
    - Zone transfers are used to replicate DNS records from a primary DNS server to secondary servers, ensuring redundancy and consistency.

- **Authoritative Name Servers**
    - Authoritative name servers provide definitive answers to DNS queries for specific domains, storing the actual DNS records for a domain.

- **Time to Live (TTL)**
    - TTL defines the duration that a DNS record is cached by clients or DNS resolvers, after which a new query is required.

- **DNS Caching**
    - DNS caching temporarily stores DNS query results to speed up future queries for the same domain.

- **Reverse DNS/Reverse Lookup/Forward Lookup**
    - Forward lookup translates domain names to IP addresses. Reverse DNS (rDNS) does the opposite, translating IP addresses to domain names using PTR records.

- **Recursive Lookup/Iterative Lookup**
    - In recursive lookups, a DNS resolver takes full responsibility for returning the answer to a DNS query, querying multiple servers if necessary. Iterative lookup involves the resolver returning a referral to another DNS server if it doesn't have the answer, requiring the client to continue the query.

- **NTP (Network Time Protocol)**
	- NTP is used to synchronize the clocks of computers and devices on a network, ensuring consistent time across the organization.
		- **Stratum**
		    - NTP uses a hierarchical system to indicate clock accuracy. Stratum 1 is the highest accuracy level, connected directly to a time source like a GPS clock. Lower stratum levels sync with higher strata, where stratum 2 devices sync to stratum 1, and so on.
		- **Clients**
		    - NTP clients are devices that receive time information from an NTP server to keep their clocks in sync with the network.
		- **Servers**
		    - NTP servers provide the accurate time source to NTP clients and other servers, either synced to a primary time source (like GPS) or to another NTP server in the hierarchy.
